# OculusGestalt
A collection of Oculus "Gestalt" installer files, used for installing Oculus. These have been collected from the internet via various places.

# Why?
Sometimes, newer is not actually better. Gestalt installer files contain the binary IDs for all installable Oculus packages (e.g. runtime, drivers, app, etc), in the future it will be possible to install these by patching the `OculusSetup` program, allowing you to use an older version of the Oculus software.
